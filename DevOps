What do DevOps Engineer exactly do:

1.DevOps engineers are someone who are responsible for deploying an application which includes creating servers, databases and also configuring them along with that, they are also responsible for monitoring and troubleshooting 
So they need to make sure that the software does not break when it is released and it is working fine all the time.

2.DevOps engineers love automation:they will try to automate every single thing,
DevOps engineers automate repetitive stuff they also automate the creation of infrastructure for an application,or configuration even the complete deployment is automated.
